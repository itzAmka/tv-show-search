# Query Shows 
**Query Shows** is a site where you can search tv shows.<br>
<br>

Query Shows uses [Tv-Maze-Api](https://www.tvmaze.com/api) to make it possible to search tv shows. <br><br>
Query Shows is the updated version of [tv-shows-search](https://tv-shows-search.netlify.app/) which I created while I was learning about AJAX.<br><br>
